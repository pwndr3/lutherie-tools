## Oud mold sections template
This script generates a set of templates for building the mold. You give the positions, face half-widths, and bowl depths of the sections and it will generate the outlines given a number of ribs. There is freedom here, so I chose to generate ellipses to have a consistent way of generating these plots that is not so hard to do on paper either.

In the case where the face and back profiles are same, this script will simply generate semi-circles and you probably don't need this tool.

Here is an example:
